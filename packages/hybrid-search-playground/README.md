# Hybrid Search Playground

## Purpose

Offline lexical and vector rank fusion with visible component scores. The package is standard-library-only and designed for deterministic local use with synthetic or caller-controlled JSON.

## Non-goals

It is not a search server, embedding service, vector database, or relevance guarantee.

## Install

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

## CLI and API

Pass a JSON object by path or standard input. Success is emitted as machine-readable JSON; validation failures return exit status 2 without a traceback.

```bash
hybrid-search-playground examples/basic.json
python -m hybrid_search_playground.cli examples/basic.json
```

The public API is `hybrid_search_playground.core.run(data)`. Lower-level functions remain available for focused library use; inspect their signatures for supported keyword options.

## Example

The example ranks two synthetic documents and shows lexical and semantic components.

```bash
hybrid-search-playground examples/basic.json
```

All example content is synthetic and safe to publish.

## Security and trust model

Every query, document, byte total, token total, vector dimension, numeric component, score weight, and result limit is validated before ranking. Cosine scoring uses scaled norms, and lexical scoring counts token frequencies in linear time.

The caller remains responsible for authenticating inputs and enforcing returned decisions at the real I/O or authorization boundary. Invalid and inconclusive inputs fail visibly rather than producing a healthy or verified claim.

## Limitations

Tokenization uses Python word characters and the caller supplies one query vector per document. Scores are demonstrations, not calibrated relevance judgments.

## Tests

Run the full local contract:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python scripts/check.py
python -m build --no-isolation
```

CI exercises Python 3.11 and 3.12, builds and installs the wheel, then runs tests, the public-boundary check, the module example, and the installed console command.
